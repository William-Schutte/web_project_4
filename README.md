### Overview
This project is the fourth project for the web-dev course. This sprint is the first to include
JavaScript, user interactivity, and communication between HTML, CSS, and JS. The project brief
was provided on Figma, an online collaborative interface prototyping tool. 

### Techniques
This page features a responsive design, editable content, a popup box, and editable form fields
powered by JS. 
Development followed best practices for Git commits, branching, and merging.
Internally, the site is designed under BEM methodology, including nested file structure.
